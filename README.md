**FayzUI is a lightweight, functional, battle tested and stable interface for 3.3.5 WoW clients that I've used for years on various servers and is mainly driven by ElvUI which is a total rewrite of the aged 3.3.5 default UI offering modern actionbars, UI scales, unitframes, bags, tooltips, buff tracking, nameplates/threat plates & more.**
   
 *Included with this package is a highly customized ElvUI profile I've created that will serve as a solid foundation for your own UI. Users can also freely import retail ElvUI profiles with no issues!* 

 **Note: My profile natively supports 1440p. 1080p gamers will need to adjust UI scale in the ElvUI config & resize elements as needed.**

## Installation
1. Backup your current Interface & WTF folders somewhere safe (Recommended)   
2. Delete Interface & WTF and unpack the ZIP. Place the provided FayzUI Interface/WTF folders in the WoW directory.
3. Navigate to /WTF, find and rename the "your-account" folder to your Chromie account name in all caps.   
4. Start WoW, login a character and when prompted complete the initial ElvUI setup wizard.
5. Type /elvui and navigate to profiles and import the string I've included in elvprofile.txt
6. Reload your UI with the /rl command.
7. Adjust UI scale in ElvUI settings and resize things as needed. This UI natively supports 1440p so 1080p users will need to do some light tinkering so treat my profile as a template!
