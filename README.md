**FayzUI is a lightweight, functional, battle tested and stable interface for 3.3.5 WoW clients that I've used for years on various servers and is mainly driven by ElvUI which is a total rewrite of the aged 3.3.5 default UI offering modern actionbars, UI scales, unitframes, bags, tooltips, buff tracking, nameplates/threat plates & more!**

## Installation
1. Backup your current Interface & WTF folders somewhere safe (Recommended)   
2. Delete Interface & WTF and unpack the ZIP. Place the provided FayzUI Interface/WTF folders in the WoW directory.
3. Navigate to /WTF, find and rename the "your-account" folder to your Chromie account name in all caps.   
4. Start WoW, login a character and when prompted complete the initial ElvUI setup wizard.
5. Type /elvui and navigate to profiles and import the string I've included in elvprofile.txt
6. Reload your UI with the /rl command.
7. Adjust UI scale in ElvUI settings and resize things as needed. This UI natively supports 1440p so 1080p users will need do some light tinkering so treat my profile as a template!
